1.                         Consider   two   identical   rooms,   one   with   a   refrigerator   in   it   and   the   other   without   one.   If all the doors   and windows   are closed,   will   the   room   that   contains   the   refrigerator   be   cooler   or   warmer   than   the   other   room? Why?
If   the   door   of   the   refrigerator   is   opened,   will   the   room   air   temperature   be   lower   or   higher   than   the   other   room   without   the   refrigerator? Why?
2.                         A   student   living   in   a   4m   x   6m   x   6m   dormitory   room   turns   his   150   W   fan   on   before   he leaves his room   on   a   summer day hoping that   the   room   will   be   cooler   when   he   comes   back   in   the   evening. Assuming all the doors and windows are tightly closed and neglecting any thermal energy transfer to/through the walls and windows,   determine   the   temperature   of   air   in   the   room   when   he   comes   back 10   hours   later.   Neglect   the   pressure   change   of   the   indoor   air. The   specific   heat   capacity   of   air   is   1007   J/kg.K. The   temperature   in   the   morning   is   15oC. The   density   of   air   can   be   treated   as constant   as   1.2kg/m3.
3.                         Water   is   heated   in   an   insulated,   constant   diameter   tube   by   a   7kW   electric   resistance heater.      If   the   water   enters   the   heater   steadily   at   15oC   and   leaves   at   70oC,   determine the   mass   flow   rate   of   water. (heat   capacity   of   water: 4190 J/kg.K)

(b)   Determine   the   mean   velocity   of   flow   in   the   pipe.
5.                         A   given   gas   sample   occupies   a   volume   of   3   liters   at   20oC   and   1atm.      What   volume   will this   sample   occupy   at   40oC   at   1atm?
6.                         A   given   gas   sample   occupies   a   volume   of   3   liters   at   20oC   at   1atm.      What   will   be   the pressure   of   the   gas   sample   if   it’sheated   to   40oC   with   fixed   volume?
7.                         The   specific   heat   capacity   ( cp ) of   air   at   a   constant   pressure   at   25oC   is   1005 J/kg.K.      At the   same   temperature,   the   specific   heat   capacity   of   air   at   a   constant   volume   ( cv )   is 718J/kg.K.    The   molar   mass   of   air   is   about   29   g/mol.      Assuming   the   volume   of   gas   at 25oC   is   22.4 liters/mol, the   density   of   air   at   25oC   is   about   1.2   kg/m3.      Suppose   we   have an   air   sample   (initially   at   1atm)   contained   in   a   container   measured by   1m x    1m   x   1m. Determine the amount of heat that is   needed   to   increase   the   air   temperature   from   25oC to   26oC   –   (a)   At   constant   volume   (1m3);   (b)   At   constant   pressure   (1atm,   consider   the top   cover   can   move   freely);
And   determine   the   work   done   by   the   air   sample   to   the   environment   for   case   (b)   due   to the   expansion   of   air.
